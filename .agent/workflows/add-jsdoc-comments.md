description: Add or update JSDoc comments
---

- Add or update JSDoc (/\*_ ... _/) comments for exported or top-level entry functions, classes (if any), and non-trivial internal helper functions.
- Document the purpose, parameters, return values, and important side effects using tags such as @param and @returns.
- Keep comments meaningful; avoid restating obvious implementation details.
- Do not change the functional behavior of the code; only improve documentation and type hints.
