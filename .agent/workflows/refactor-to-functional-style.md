description: Refactor the selected code into a more functional an declarative style
---

- Refactor the selected code into a more functional and declarative style.
- Extract pure functions, reduce side effects, and avoid shared mutable state where possible.
- Prefer small, composable functions and expression-oriented code over large imperative blocks.
- Preserve existing public APIs and external behavior; refactoring should be non-breaking.
